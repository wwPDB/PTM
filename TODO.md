## Soon
- Proofread and edit the documentation
- Add an example of a real isopeptide bond

## Maybe unnecessary 

- Examples have unrelated CIF categories reordered which makes them hard to compare
  - Should we just copy the new categories into the original instead
  - This would make the changes clearer

## Close to rollout

- Double check that PLP _chem_comp.pcm is definitely set to N
  - If it isn't then we might need to use a different example like MYK/MYR+LYS
- Closer to the news release populate the summary files
- Just before the news release, regenerate the CCDs and mmCIF examples based on them
- Remove TODO.txt
