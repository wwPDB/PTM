## Protein Modification Remediation

The documents in this repository include content extension definitions and data 
files for the upcoming Protein Modification Remediation Project at PDB, including:

- [Description](Protein_modifications.md) of the new annotation categories
- [Details](Standardizing_protein_modifications.md) of the changes performed to standardize protein modification handling
- [Examples](examples/examples.md) of PDB entries that contain the new PCM data category
- The full set of Chemical Component Definition files ([CCDs](data/data.md)) updated in the protein modification 
remediation
- [Summary](summaries/summaries.md) datasets that provide an overview of the changes to CCD, PRD and entry files
- All the [protein modification annotations](data/summaries/full_protein_modification_annotation.xlsx) in a single tabular format
- Chemical Component Dictionary Extension for both the backbone remediation and 
protein modification remediation [(text)](dict/ptm-extension.dic) 
[(markdown)](dict/ptm-extension.md)
