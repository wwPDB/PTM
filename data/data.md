## Updated chemical component files

This directory contains all the chemical component definition (CCD) files that will change as part of the Protein Modification Remediation Project.
It also contains summaries describing how these CCD files are affected by the remediation and which entries contain protein modifications

These can be accessed [individually](ccds) or you may download the CCDs as a [compressed tar file](tars/all-ccds.tar.gz).

New protein modifications are regularly entering the PDB archive. Until the remediation date, we will update this repository to contain the full set of chemical components affected.
